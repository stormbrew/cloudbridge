CloudBridge
---
- Bridges gap between web frontend and backend by allowing each to connect to it. It then does matchmaking on the connections (using Host header)
  to decide which backend to give to which frontend.
- This avoids the problem of starving or overfeeding a backend because of poor metrics -- the backend knows damn well what it can handle,
  and only asks for what it can take.
