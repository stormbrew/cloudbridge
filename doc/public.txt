Public Cloudbridge Server
---
Have a copy of cloudbridge running on a public port, a wildcard subdomain mapping to its ip, and a web interface to register a name and
get a key for your app.

This requires the following things to be finished implementing in cloudbridge:
- Accepting keys for hosts
- Memory leaks and random disconnections generally cleaned up (but both of those probably acceptable for desired SLA)
- Website on which you can register for a key

- Use * handler to make it occasionally give back a "Please donate" page?
