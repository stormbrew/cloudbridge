(BRIDGE requests have no body and so MUST NOT have any Content-* headers. Content bodies are reserved for a future version. A server
that does not recognize them should return a 501 error rather than ignore it.)

A BRIDGE request is sent to the server asking the server to give it the next available user-facing request (GET/POST/etc) sent
to it that matches the parameters in the BRIDGE request. A request matches if it matches ANY of the Host headers passed, prefix matches
the url component of the BRIDGE request itself, and if it matches all If-* headers passed (see below on If-* headers).

A wildcard host header of * may also be specified, which will accept a request for any host passed by the client. Wilcards will
only be matched in the absence of a fully matching domain name, and it is recommended that you not mix use of the two.

A server MAY require the hosts to be accompanied by a signature which is calculated by SHA1(host+shared secret) where shared secret is a
string known by the server. This is to allow for bridging relatively untrusted clients. The client may be given a list of hosts and keys
they can map to, and they will not be able to use their access to the server to subvert other domains on the same network. 

Logical Expressions
---
Each If- header indicates a match parameter for any requests coming in. None have been defined as yet, but when they are they will be
documented here.

Response
---
The immediate response to a BRIDGE request will be either a 101 Upgrade status code or an error code. 101 indicates that the server is willing and able to find a match for this connection and will immediately be supplying a reply. The server may also send one or more 100 Continue codes back before supplying either an error or a 101. The 101 reply will be accompanied by an Upgrade: header with the value HTTP/1.[01]. This is to indicate a resetting of the connection to the reverse.

After a 101 Upgrade status code, the connection will be routed to an available frontend connection and the response will actually be a fresh HTTP request which should be replied to as if it had been part of a listen/accept cycle.

However, some errors may occur and they will be replied to with an error code as if it were a normal HTTP request. To clarify this, the
response on a successful connection will be something like:
HTTP/1.1 101 Upgrade
Upgrade: HTTP/1.1

GET / HTTP/1.1

And on an error will be something like:
HTTP/1.1 501 Not Implemented
Content-Length: NN

Bridge not support If-Cookie-Match.

The following error conditions MAY be returned from a BRIDGE request:
- 401 Unauthorized: The server does not accept one of the host sha1-keys and so will not bridge for the url specified.
- 404 Not Found: The server will not bridge for the Host or url specified due to configuration.
- 405 Method Not Allowed: The server does not support the BRIDGE request. This would happen if the BRIDGE request were sent to a server
  that does not actually act as a bridge server.
- 501 Not Implemented: The server does not support one (or all) of the If- statements given. It may also be given on an incomplete 
  implementation that does not do prefix matching of the url component.
- 504 Gateway Timeout: The server was not able to find a match within a reasonable timeout (as configured by the server).
